What is Self-Awareness?

Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It involves being aware of our strengths and weaknesses, our values, beliefs, and biases. Self-awareness helps us to identify areas where we need to grow and improve.

* Understand how our emotions and mindset affect our learning
* Reflect on our progress and adjust our approach accordingly

The Benefits of Self-Compassion

Self-compassion is the practice of treating ourselves with kindness, empathy, and understanding. It involves acknowledging our mistakes and shortcomings without judgment or self-criticism. Self-compassion helps us to cultivate a positive relationship with ourselves.

In the context of learning, self-compassion can help us to:

* Embrace our imperfections and mistakes as part of the learning process
